    Models
-----------------------------------------------------------
- switched affine systems are collections of affine systems indexed by discrete index variable
	- discrete state
- piecewise affine (PWA) systems are a special class of switched affine systems
	- partition input domain into finite polyhedral regions
- input-out counterparts
	- switched ARX (SARX)
	- piecewise ARX (PWARX)
	- most proposed methods is about identifying these
		- realization theory on how to convert to state-space

    Questions
-----------------------------------------------------------
- what is the difference between switched and piecewise affine?
